# Example Kubernetes Workloads 

## Welcome! 

This repo contains 3 different example applications that you can deploy to a Kubernetes cluster. 

Please note that these applications were created for educational purposes and are not suited for long-running production settings. 

## Examples 
These are the workloads and the kind of Kubernetes resource that serves them best: 

1. An example API written in Go that is deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment
1. A Kubernetes DaemonSet
1. A Kubernetes Job
