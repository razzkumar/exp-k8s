# Generate UUID
This is a Kubernetes manifest that creates a Job. The Job creates a pod running an Ubuntu container, and the generates a list of test emails with UUIDS. The pod will run for 60 seconds and then terminate. 

The original commands are from the DigitalOcean Tutorial [How To Generate Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) with uuidgen](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/workflow-command-line-basics-generating-uuids). 



Here's the kind of output you should see when you look at the logs for the pod:
